This is a small project created to understand and learn the **basic workflow of Machine Learning (ML)**. It demonstrates how to load data, preprocess it, train a model, and make predictions.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Learn the fundamental steps of a machine learning project.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn
- 
## Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Load the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean and prepare data for training.
3. **Model Selection** – Choose a machine learning algorithm.
4. **Training** – Train the model on the dataset.
5. **Evaluation** – Test the model and evaluate its performance.
6. **Prediction** – Make predictions using the trained model.
